        <h3>Database Study Organization</h3>
        In the MPS-Db, a study contains all data and metadata associated to an experiment designed to assess MPS model response. A list of studies in the MPS-Db, with summary information about the MPS models used in the study and associated assay results, is provided on the <b>Study List</b> page. A study can contain multiple study treatment groups and a study treatment group can include multiple study items. Each study item can have multiple data points, images and/or videos associated to it.

When an MPS model is constructed using a plate device, wells from one or more plates can be assigned to the same study treatment group, or to different study treatment groups. </td>

Processed assay data can be directly uploaded to a study for immediate presentation on the <b>Study Summary</b> page via the MPS import friendly columnar (MIF-C) file format. Raw assay plate reader data, exported from an assay plate reader, can be uploaded to a study and processed using the plate reader data processing tool provided in the database. After processing, those data join with other processed data and are available for presentation on the <b>Study Summary</b> page. All processed assay data that have been submitted for presentation on the <b>Study Summary</b> page can be visualized/analyzed within the individual study (intra-study), across studies (inter-study), and/or in combination with curated reference data. </td>
